# Green Yoga (https://www.greenyoga.com.au)
  - A front-end React.js application for Green Park's yoga business.
  - The repository for the back-end (built on Express.js) can be found at: https://github.com/shouheiyamauchi/green-yoga-server
------
### Client Contact

Below are some notes from each of the interactions I had with the client throughout the whole project:

  - Had initial discussion to get the background and set out the requirements
  - Talked about what is realistically achievable given the time frame of 2 weeks vs what she wanted included ideally
  - Went through a few existing websites of other yoga studios together to get an idea of what the end product should look like
  - Was handed over some rough wireframes
  - Checked if colour palette of components such as buttons, font colours, etc were okay and adjusted according to what the client wanted
  - Received a USB of the client's photoshoot to be used for the website
  - Demoed the features such as the booking function to ensure that the client is satisfied with the ease of use
  - Discussed and received approval from client in relation to the inability of integrating the payment feature by the deadline

### Background
------
  - As a recently certified yoga instructor, the client, Green Park required a website to promote herself
  - Also needed a way for her to display her classes schedule to others and make bookings via the website
------
### Features

  - A small profile text
  - Gallery of herself performing yoga
  - A way to contact her
  - Add/edit classes and the details such as the type of yoga and location
  - A way for her students to book themselves into a class and a dashboard showing their upcoming classes
------
### Application Design

  - Used Trello for planning out, draw.io for the ERD, went through wireframing with client
  - Used Express.js for back-end with the API end points, React.js for front-end doing the API calls
