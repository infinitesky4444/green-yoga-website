# Green Yoga (https://www.greenyoga.com.au)
  - A front-end React JS application for Green Park's yoga business.
  - The repository for the back-end (built on Node.js / Express.js) can be found at: https://github.com/shouheiyamauchi/green-yoga-server
------
### Project Brief

You are to design, build, deploy and present an application built for a real world customer. Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an application and present your ideas to the client.
------
### Background
- As a recently certified yoga instructor, the client, Green Park required a website to promote herself
- Also needed a way for her to display her classes schedule to others and make bookings via the website
------
### Client Contact
Notes were taken from each of the interaction I had with the client:
- Initial discussion to get the background and set out the requirements
- Talked about what is realistically achievable given the time frame of 2 weeks vs what client wanted to include ideally
- Went through a few existing websites of other yoga studios together to get an idea of what the end product should look like
- Was handed over some rough wireframes
- Checked if colour palette of components such as buttons, font colours, etc were okay and adjusted according to what the client wanted
- Received a USB of the client's photoshoot to be used for the website
- Demoed the features such as the booking function to ensure that the client is satisfied with the ease of use
- Discussed and received approval from client in relation to the inability of integrating the payment feature by the deadline
------
### Features
- A small profile text
- Gallery of herself performing yoga
- A way to contact her
- Add/edit classes and the details such as the type of yoga and location
- A way for her students to book themselves into a class and a dashboard showing their upcoming classes
------
### Application Design
- Used Trello for planning out, draw.io for the ERD, went through wireframing with client
- Used Express.js for back-end with the API end points, React.js for front-end doing the API calls
